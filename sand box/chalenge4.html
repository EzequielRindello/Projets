          From the image below create a webpage to look just like it. Try using
          grid for the layout. <br />
          The grid doesn't necessarily need to be the whole card but at least
          the bottom portion of the card. <br />
          The card below has a small width so it should look good on any screen.
          The image below is how it would look on a medium size screen. <br />
          You are welcome to work in groups. The image is provided below.
