        Why I choose a portfolio ? <br>
        Doing a little bit of searching I found that:
        1-	A portfolio is not only useful for external stakeholders but also for individuals or businesses themselves. It serves as a personal record of progress, growth, and milestones achieved over time. <br>
        2-	A portfolio allows individuals or businesses to demonstrate their skills, expertise, and capabilities in a tangible and visual manner. It provides evidence of past projects, accomplishments, and the ability to deliver results. It allows potential clients, employers, or stakeholders to assess the quality of work and determine if it aligns with their needs and expectations. <br>
        3-	In a competitive market, a portfolio acts as a powerful tool for standing out from the competition. It allows individuals or businesses to highlight their unique strengths, approaches, and creative solutions. A well-presented portfolio demonstrates a distinct value proposition and can be a decisive factor in securing opportunities or partnerships. <br>
        4-	A portfolio serves to inspire confidence in potential clients or employers by demonstrating the quality and depth of work. It provides a glimpse into the individual's or organization's capabilities, creativity, and attention to detail. A strong portfolio can alleviate doubts and concerns, reassuring stakeholders that they are making the right choice in selecting a particular professional or company. <br>
        5-  A portfolio is not only useful for external stakeholders but also for individuals or businesses themselves. It serves as a personal record of progress, growth, and milestones achieved over time. By reviewing past projects and reflecting on lessons learned, professionals can refine their approach, identify areas of improvement, and set new goals for future endeavors. <br>
        <br>
        purpose <br>
        The purpose of this portfolio is to show the skills that I learned throughout my studies at BYU Idaho. Show that I completed several programming courses and that I was able to acquire proficiency in several languages at an initial level. The idea of this is that it is aimed at recruiters or companies that are offering an entry level job. When it is finished and the details are fully polished, post it on LinkedIn.

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        [Working parts <br>
        In the about me part, the idea is to introduce myself to potential recruiters and tell a little about what I know and who I am. It is also to make clear what my skills are and give the option that they can contact me. The idea is that it be a simple but effective "screenshot" of myself as a future programmer. The activities that users will be able to do on my website is to be able to know about me, visit my public professional profiles and thoroughly review the projects and courses that I complete. The idea is that they have a knowledge of me as a professional. I plan to use my Java, C#, and python projects. Describe a bit of each one and allow the user to visit the code and, if possible, be able to interact with it.
        <br>
        What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers? <br>
        The idea is to explain a little the course projects that I take in more depth. Explain the type of programming that is either oop or procedural or funtional. My idea was always to try to put a console so the user could interact with the code but it's kind of complicated because I would need to use JavaScript and I don't know how to do it! But it could be something in the future that I would add. I have many projects so I don't know how I would show each one so I was thinking of finding a way to show the most important ones and give them the option to visit my GitHub so that if they are interested, they can see everything
