          <p class="box-1-p">
            The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return
            by the people living near it because of the number <br />
            of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged
            <br />
            beauty of the river that they never left. <br />
            Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon
            is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. <br />As
            a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, <br />and colder
            in the early summer and lower,<br />
            slower, and warmer in the late summer.<br />
            There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who
            <br />like to swim tend to appreciate<br />
            the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

          <p class="box-2-p">
            Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most
            desolate land anywhere, the Green <br />river flows towards the
            mighty <br />
            Colorado river and the sea. <br />
            High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, <br />
            and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs
            from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah)
            <br />
            and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations,
            evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, <br />
            and great whitewater opportunities. <br />
            Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
            Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This
            designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the
            canyon tells.
