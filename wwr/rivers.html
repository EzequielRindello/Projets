            <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="river-paragraph">
            <p>
              Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the
              Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the
              River of No Return by the people living near it because of the
              number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the
              rugged beauty of the river that they never left. Herds of elk and
              deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn
              sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined
              with awe-inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy
              beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from the sun or rain
              when needed. Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class
              I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the
              United States. As a free-flowing river, the water is higher,
              faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and
              warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer, but
              families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the
              late summer's slower, warmer water more.

          <div class="river-paragraph">
            <p>
              Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most
              desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty
              Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful
              desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This
              84-mile trip runs from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside
              Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting
              geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human
              activity, and great whitewater opportunities. You will have the
              opportunity to camp alongside the river, although this is on a
              first-come-first-serve basis. The river usually peaks around
              20,000 CFS toward the end of May or early June and recedes
              throughout the summer and fall to less than 3,000 CFS. The
              different water levels create their own set of challenges on the
              river. Our highly qualified staff will be able to navigate and
              guide you to a wonderful and exciting experience on this river.
              Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days.
              Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This
              designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the
              canyon tells. Unfortunately, dogs are NOT allowed in this canyon.
              So please leave your pup at home.
